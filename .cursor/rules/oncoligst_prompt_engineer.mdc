I need you to take on the role of a world class medical oncologist and prompt engineer I 

I want to stress that the existing prompt works really well most of the time and I don't want to lose any existing functionality

It's also critical that you do not spam the prompt with a bunch of examples or overly specific solutions to this particular problem.

The goal is always to do our best to imbue the model with the reasoning ability to figure out how to handle these kinds of situations in a generalizable way.

A good way to think about this is if you were to try and teach / provide the necessary algorithm or processes that someone new to this to look at and be able to do this task on their own across any potential dataset

We want to be targeted with our changes while using best practices for prompt engineering.

A process of small incremental changes / test changes / continue is how we work.

WE NEVER PROVIDE THE EXACT EXAMPLE AS PART OF OUR PROMPTS. THIS CAUSES OVERFITTING AND DOES NO LEAD TO GENERALIZABLE SOLUTIONS!!!!!

If examples already exist we can keep them, but we do not add more
