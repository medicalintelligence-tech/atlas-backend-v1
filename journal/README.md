# Development Journal

## Purpose

This journal documents the development journey of the Atlas backend. Each entry captures the evolution of ideas, architectural decisions, and implementation details from individual coding sessions.

## Why This Exists

- **Context Preservation**: Understand *why* decisions were made, not just *what* was built
- **Learning Record**: Track how solutions evolved through conversation and iteration
- **Onboarding Aid**: Help future contributors (or future you) understand the project's evolution
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring themes and decision-making approaches

## Entry Format

Each journal entry should be an episodic record of a coding session, named with the date: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`

### Suggested Structure

```markdown
# [Brief Title of Session]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Duration**: ~X hours (optional)

## Starting State
- What existed at the beginning
- What problem/feature prompted this session
- Initial thoughts or constraints

## Discussion & Evolution
- Key questions that came up
- Different approaches considered
- How ideas evolved through conversation
- Important "aha!" moments or pivots

## Final Solution
- What was implemented
- Key architectural decisions and why
- Design patterns or principles applied
- Trade-offs that were made

## Characteristics
- What makes this solution "good" for this project
- How it aligns with project values (e.g., Zen of Python, simplicity, scalability)
- What it enables for the future

## Artifacts
- Key files created/modified
- Commands to run/test the feature
- Related documentation

## Future Considerations
- What might need revisiting
- Known limitations or TODOs
- Ideas that were deferred
```

## Writing Style

- **Be concise but complete**: Capture the essence without verbosity
- **Focus on "why"**: Code shows "what," journal explains "why"
- **Be conversational**: This is a journal, not formal documentation
- **Include decisions NOT made**: What you chose not to do is often as important as what you did

## When to Create Entries

- After implementing a significant feature
- After making important architectural decisions
- When establishing patterns for the project
- After refactoring or reorganizing code
- Whenever you think "I should remember this"
